# COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification

## Overview
This project builds a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into COVID and Normal categories. The workflow includes preprocessing, CNN development, transfer learning using ResNet-50, model training, and evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Methods
- Image resizing and normalization
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Transfer learning (ResNet-50)
- Early stopping and checkpointing
- Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation

## How to Run
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open and execute:
`covid_xray_classification.ipynb`

## Notes
- Dataset is not included due to licensing restrictions.
- Add instructions or a link to download the dataset separately.
