# COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification

This project implements a deep learning–based image classification system for analyzing chest X-ray images to distinguish between COVID-19 and normal cases. The solution applies convolutional neural networks and transfer learning techniques to extract discriminative visual features from medical imaging data.

The project focuses on leveraging pretrained deep learning architectures to improve classification performance while reducing training complexity. Model behavior and performance are evaluated using standard classification metrics and visual analysis, demonstrating how deep learning can be applied to medical image analysis tasks in applied healthcare and diagnostic research contexts.
